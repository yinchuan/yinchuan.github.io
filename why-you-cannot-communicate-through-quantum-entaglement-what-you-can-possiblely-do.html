</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>This is a note when watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_Riqjdh2oM&amp;ab_channel=MicrosoftResearch">Quantum Computing for Computer Scientists</a>. Please not it could be wrong.</p>
<p>A qubit, when measured, collapses to state 1 or 0 following a probablistic distribution. An entangled pair of qubits has a property of any one is measure collapes the other. This happens instantaously no matter how far the two qubits apart so it's faster than the speed of light.</p>
<p>Is there a way to utilize this property to communicate faster than ligth speed? The answer is no. Here the communication is defined as a sender to transmit some information to a receiver. The content being transmitted can't be random so the sender must have a way to manipulate the pair of qubits such that the receiver get the intended content. It's obvious that the sender has no control of what state a qubit will collapse to since it's purely probablistic.</p>
<p>The property could be used for key distribution. The result of key distribution is that the sender and receiver share a key which is secret to a third party. The key can be used for encryption in subsequent communication. A simple protocol could be:</p>
<ol>
<li>Alice and Bob eash has half of an entangled pair of qubits. Let's say they have enough number of those.</li>
<li>Alice and Bob negotiate the qubits to be used in this session. Let's say they agree to use qubit0 to qubit255.</li>
<li>Alice measures its qubits and gets result KEY which is a 256bits binary string.</li>
<li>Bob measures its qubits and get result KEY'. The qubits pairs can be manipulate such the relationship between KEY and KEY' is determined, for example both collaps to 0 or 1. Bob calculates KEY from KEY'.</li>
<li>Now Alice and Bob shares the same key.</li>
</ol>
<p>Update: This naive protocol can't detect eavesdropping. It uses only the standard basis for measuring so only intermediate party can use the same basis to obtain the key without being detected. Ekert Protocol solves this issue by utlizing three different bases. It can detect eavesdropping with very high probability.</p>
